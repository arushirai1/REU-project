	<p>I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Illinois Tech. I am currently doing representation learning research under Dr. Yogesh Rawat at UCF. I hope to go to graduate school to continue doing research in representation learning and multimodal machine learning. I am also interested in understanding and reasoning in humans and producing these properties in machines.</p>
