### Week One
  I spent this week getting familiar with Cobalt's administrative and user commands. I have almost finished installing the simulation environment on a CentOS 6.4 VM based on VirtualBox. Alongside reading about the Cobalt platform, I read the following paper: [Fault-Aware, Utility-Based Job Scheduling on Blue Gene/P systems](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~iraicu/teaching/CS550-S11/cluster09_wtang.pdf). I learned about the various utlitily functions that can optimize the job selection process, as well as fault-aware job allocation. I found it interesting that the basic FCFS beats all of the proposed smart utility functions when it came to large, time consuming jobs. However, the real efficiency that is derived from smart utility functions is by cutting down the average response rate for shorter job. This paper also explored QSim and Blue Gene systems briefly which helped my understanding of how the elements depend on each other.
